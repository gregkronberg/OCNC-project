to do

-analysis module
	-add comments
	-detect peak voltage in a given section

-experiments
	-subthreshold integration
		-apply subthreshold inputs to different branches
		-apply an increasing number of simultaneous input
		-record somatic voltage
		-does dcs act independently on each branch?
			-if so, dcs effects should scale with the number of independent branches that are activated

	-sequences
		-See Branco and Hausser 2010 for motivation
		-branches amplify sequences due to gradient of impedence and dendritic nonlinearities
		-choose a dendritic branch and increase the discretization to ~20 segments.  apply sequences of inputs along the branch. sequences going from distal to proximal should be amplified. does dcs boost this amplification?


	- dendritic spike probability
		- does dcs enhance dendritic spike probability during poisson trains

	-tbs experiments
		-replicate asif's tbs experiments, including asymmetry
		-can asymmetry be explained by dendritic spiking
